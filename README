                                 RCUNIT
                   A Robust C Unit Testing Framework
                     http://rcunit.sourceforge.net

I. Introduction

This is the README file of RCUNIT distribution version 0.9. This is
is the prerelease version of 1.0. There were no major changes from
version 0.1.

II. About RCUNIT

    RCUNIT is a robust C unit testing framework. It is built as a static
library for linking with the user test code. RCUNIT should work in any
platform with an ANSI/ISO-compliant C compiler.

    See NEWS for new features.
    See ChangeLog file for source code changes.
    See INSTALL file for detailed installation procedures.

III. Documentation

    1. User manual (Info and HTML formats, generated by GNU makefile)
    2. Source documentation (HTML, generated by Doxygen)

The Info documentation is installed as part of the standard
installation procedure "make install". The user manual and source
documentation can be generated manually.

To generate the HTML user manual, go to the "doc" directory and run the
following command.

    $makeinfo --html rcunit.texi

A directory "rcunit" containing the HTML documentation will be created.

To generate the HTML source documentation, go to the "doc" directory
and run the following command.

    $doxygen rcunit.doxy

A directory "srcdoc/html" containing the HTML documentation will be created.

IV. Building RCUNIT

Unix/Linux platform:
--------------------

   1. Configure the package
        $./configure

      To configure the package for debug mode:

        $./configure --enable-debug=yes

      The --prefix={installation directory} can be given to the
      configure script. If not given, the default prefix (/usr/local) is
      used.

   2. Build the package, samples, basic tests, and documentation
        $make

   3. Install the package
        $make install

   4. To uninstall the package
        $make uninstall

   See the INSTALL file for more details.

What Gets Installed?

   1. RCUNIT static library (librcunit.a) in {prefix}/lib
   2. RCUNIT header files in {prefix}/include
   3. Info documentation in {prefix}/info

Windows Platform :
------------------

A. Microsoft Visual C++ Version 6

   1. Build the package, samples, basic tests
      To build RCUNIT alone:
        a. Open build\win32_lib_msvc6\rcunit_lib.dsw
        b. Perform a `Rebuild All`

      To build RCUNIT and samples :
        a. Open build\win32_samples_msvc6\rcunit_samples.dsw
        b. Perform a `Rebuild All`

      To build RCUNIT and basic tests:
        a. Open build\win32_test_msvc6\rcunit_test.dsw
        b. Perform a `Rebuild All`

      To build the debug-mode version of RCUNIT, select the Debug
      configuration and perform a `Rebuild All`.

    2. To use RCUNIT, the library file (rcunit.lib) and header files
       (rcunit_*.h) must be setup in the build environment of the user
       test code.
